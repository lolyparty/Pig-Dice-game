Pig (dice game) is a game played by two players roll a pair of dice and the first player to reach the winning score wins the game.


Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls the pair of dice by clicking the ROLL button until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or the score set by the two players wins.
